# Doge Dog Day Care - Project Portfolio 1 - HTML & CSS

 Doge Dog Day Care is a small company which hopes to help people who want to go on holidays or even spend long hours on a site without being concerned with the dog's care. The website will be targeted toward dog owners who are looking for a way to do what they need to without leaving the dogs on its own. Doge Dog Day Care will also be useful for dog owners to find places where they can socialize and take their pets together.
