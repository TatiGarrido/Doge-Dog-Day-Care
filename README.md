# Doge Dog Day Care - Project Portfolio 1 - HTML & CSS

 Doge Dog Day Care is a small company which hopes to help people who want to go on holidays or even spend long hours on a site without being concerned with the dog's care. The website will be targeted toward dog owners who are looking for a way to do what they need to without leaving the dogs on its own. Doge Dog Day Care will also be useful for dog owners to find places where they can socialize and take their pets together.

 Welcome to the live project here: [Doge Dog Day Care](https://tatigarrido.github.io/Doge-Dog-Day-Care/)

 ## User Experience (UX)
 ### User stories

   ## Design

   * Colour Scheme
      * The two main colour used are coral and white.

   * Typography   
      * The DynaPuff and Roboto are the fonts that were used more often throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. The chosen fonts are ideal for the purpose of the website, which is: be fun and trustable.

   * Imagery
      * The large, background hero image is designed to catch the user's attention. The images on the testimonials page are designed to show users that customers and reviews are real and so are those dogs. The background image on the contact us page is designed to give the website some padding in a page where customers should fill with details only.  



   ## Wireframes
   The wireframes were produced on Balsamiq. They were built as being part of the first version of the website. Modifications were made throughout the website development.
